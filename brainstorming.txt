Okay... I think I am going to have a lot of fun with this one.

For the actual population of data, I'm obviously going to use what I learned from the previous two challenges: using fetch() to return
resonses, turning those responses into json so I can use them.

I have to options for the fetch request: 

Option one is

fetch(url)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => {
  doSomething(data);
});

the second is

const fetchData = async () => {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();
  showPokeData(data);
}

Gotta get better with knowing the syntax off the top of my head, but my heart's in the right place.

I'll probably do the second one. I think it looks a little nicer.

To populate data, I'll have a table in the html and I'll add td's with the variables I get from the url.
Gotta deconstruct.
